it starts the Tomcat server on port 8080. If you access the http://localhost:8080/employees URL from the browser, you will get JSON response of customers as the response.

If you want to start the application on different port than the default one, you can specify the port by suing --server.port option as follows.

java --server.port=9000 -jar target/spring-boot-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
If you want to start the application with debug enabled, you can use the following command:

java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=n -jar target/spring-boot-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
To start the application with debug log enabled, you can use the following command:

java -jar target/spring-boot-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --debug
If you want to specify the sever running port in ‘application.properties‘ file, you can include the following property into the file.

server.port=${port:9000}
With above entry in application.properties file, instead of using --server.port option, you can simply user --port option with java -jar command in order to specify the port.

Most of the time, your configuration properties are different from environment to environment. 
For environment like, development, production and testing, you might need to keep different set of configuration properties. 
You can do this by keeping different configuration profiles for each environment.

You should create the configuration properties file in the following format in order to achieve this.

application-${profile}.properties
Let’s say you need to keep two configuration profiles for ‘development’ and ‘production’ environment separately. 
In this case, you should create two property files as application-development.properties and application-production.properties.

When starting the application using java -jar command, you should specify the profile with -D parameter as follows:

java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=production customer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
